TOX-G: Major changes
================================================================================

Version 0.1-alpha1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 + Added common variables (which are used throughout all templates.)
 + Added the "requires" attribute to tpl:template so templates may explicitly
   require parameters.
 * Templates are now compiled together and optimized based on a pre-build
   phase.  This changes the exposed API a bit.
 * There are now wrapper templates to ensure that overlays are applied to top
   level template calls.
